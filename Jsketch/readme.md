# JSketch

Jsketch is a drawing application created using native Java Swing components. You can draw various shapes with different colours and
border widths and also choose to either move or delete any existing shapes. Colours can be chosen either from the colour pallette or 
from a custom colour picker.

The size of the canvas is also resizable. It is defaulted to be set to full view which will add scrollbars as the window increases 
in size. Hence if the window increases, the canvas will always increase but if the window size decreases, it will use the largest
canvas size so far as reference and add scrollbars appropriately. If the scaling option is chosen, it will scale down the shapes and 
the canvas according to the window size.

Canvases can also be saved and loaded appropriately using the menu options. As a demo, you can load in the jPanelDrawing.txt to try this
out or just go right ahead and save your own images. Shortcuts to these menu items have been added for convenience.

You can run `make run` with Java installed to run the application locally. The application was tested thoroughly on a Windows and Linux 
environment with Java 10.0.3 installed.
