## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (60)

1. [3/5] Saving and loading data. File-Save can be used to save the model and File-Load can be used to load and restore the shapes that were saved. The user should be promoted for a file-save location using a JDialog.

-2 user is prompted with the location to save the file while the file is saved in the assignment folder. 

2. [2/2] File-New can be used to discard the current document and create a new blank document.

3. [3/3] Selection tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar then click on a shape to select it. There should be some visual indication which shape is selected. Pressing ESC on the keyboard will clear shape selection.

4. [2/2] Erase tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar then click on a shape to delete it.

5. [4/4] Line drawing tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then draw lines in the canvas by holding and dragging the mouse.

6. [4/4] Rectangle drawing tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then draw rectangles in the canvas by holding and dragging the mouse.

7. [4/4] Circle drawing tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then draw circles or ellipses in the canvas by holding and dragging the mouse.

8. [3/3] Fill tool: The user can select this tool in the toolbar and then click on a shape (rectangle or circle/ellipse) to fill it with the current colour.

9. [2/7] Colour palette. Displays at least 6 colors in a graphical view, which the user can select to set the property for drawing a new shape.

-5 Colour palette not implemented or doesn't work --> They all show up as black. Looks like a bug

difficult to test these as colors do not show up:
-2 New lines are not drawn with the selected colour
-2 New rectangles are not drawn with the selected colour
-2 New circles are not drawn with the selected colour

10. [2/3] Colour picker. The user can click on the "Chooser" button to bring up a colour chooser dialog to select a colour.

-1 There is no visual indication of the selected colour

11. [7/7] Line thickness palette. Displays at least 3 line widths, graphically, and allows the user to select line width for new shapes.

12. [2/2] Selecting a shape will cause the color palette and line thickness palette to update their state to reflect the currently selected shape.

13. [5/10] Moving shapes. Users can move shapes around the screen by selecting, then dragging them. There should be an indication which shape is selected. 

-5 Movement is not smooth (for example, the shape jumps around while being moved)
and at times shapes do not move at all

14. [1/2] The interface should clearly indicate which tool, color and line thickness are selected at any time.

-1 The interface does not indicate which tool is selected at least in one situation
Tools or colors do not show up while a box that indicates they are selected appears. It's difficult to test.

15. [2/2] The interface should enable/disable controls if appropriate.


## LAYOUT (15)

1. [1/1] The starting appication window is no larger than 1600x1200.

2. [2/4] Swing widgets are used appropriately to implement the window layout.

-2 There was an issue with the layout (for example, some controls were difficult to use or incorrectly positioned)
Tools and colors do not show up (all black)

3. [5/5] The application should support dynamic resizing of the window. The tool palettes should expand and contract based upon available space, and they should remain usable at all times.

4. [5/5] If the user resizes the window smaller than the canvas, scrollbars should appear.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND MVC (15)

1. [5/5] Makefile exists, `make` and `make run` works successfully with default arguments.

2. [10/10] Model-View-Controller (MVC) used effectively (i.e. shape model contained in a model class, at least two views used to represent the canvas and/or toolbars).

## ADDITIONAL/BONUS FEATURES (10 + 10 optional bonus)

1. [4/10] Application incorporates one or more enhancements totaling 10%, as described in the requirements.

+5 Customizable color palette: you can wholly or partially customize color buttons in the palette (e.g. right-click a button and choose a new color for that button from a color-chooser dialog).
-1 Colors do not show up so it's not possible to test if the pallet is indeed customized after a new color is selected


2. [10/10] Bonus feature: Resizing. The user can toggle between scaling the canvas full-size, or scaling the canvas and its contents to the window. The "Full size" mode is like the default (the canvas and its contents remain the same size as you resize the window, and scrollbars appear to let you scroll the image). In the "Fit to Window" mode, the canvas and its contents resize to fit the window as the window is resized.
