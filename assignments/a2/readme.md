For the extra feature, I chose to implement the customizable colour pallet which can change colour by right clicking 
and selecting a colour.

I have also implemented the bonus feature. It is defaulted to be set to full view which will add scrollbars as the window increases 
in size. Hence if the window increases, the canvas will always increase but if the window size decreases, it will use the largest
canvas size as reference and add scrollbars appropriately. If the scaling option is chosen, it will scale down the shapes and the canvas according to the window size.
