This application was created on a windows 10 machine using Java 10.0.2. Note that the source code builds on top of the demo sprites application build by Michael Terry & Jeff Avery. 

For the addional features, I implemented the addition of other figures that can be populated onto the screen. The additional figures can be found under the add section of the menu bar. Note that the scarecrow also can move its eyes!

Please execute "make run" to start up the application.
