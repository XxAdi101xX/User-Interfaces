You can run the application by downloading the fotog-app apk found at the root of this folder. Just a heads up, the reload icon is put as a default image to show that an item is "loading" and then once the async tasks retrieves the image, the image is replaced. The ratings can also be cleared simply by dragging on the widget off to the left side. This application should work exactly as intended and follows all of the guidelines presented in the assignment specifications. The application was tested on the Pixel (API 26) device. Thanks!
