Fotag is an photo filtering application which loads in images from a remote server (in this case, University of Waterloo's CS349 directory
with images of cute animals). These images can then be ranked from 1 to 5 stars and you can also choose to filter the entire application 
to only show images that have a rank equal or greater than the rank you specified. State is also maintained on orientation change or when
the app is backgrounded before being brought to the foreground again. Photoes can be reloaded by clicking on the load icon at the top of
the application. Similarily, all of the ranks can be cleared when clicking on the slanted hamburger icon.

You can run the application by downloading the fotog-app apk found at the root. The application was tested on the Pixel (API 26) emulator and developed using Android Studio.
